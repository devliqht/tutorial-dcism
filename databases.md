# Databases
You can create your own SQL database through the [admin control panel](https://admin.dcism.org), and you can manage your databases through [https://dbadmin.dcism.org/](https://dbadmin.dcism.org/).

:::tip
Database names are always appended with a prefix with your username and an underscore (e.g `s22103604_`).

## Logging in
To login to your [phpmyadmin](https://dbadmin.dcism.org/), set the username to the database name (`s22103604_chiase` in this case) and the password to the password you set for the database on the admin control panel.
