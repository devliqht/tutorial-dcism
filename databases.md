# Databases
You can set up and control your own MySQL database using the DCISM web server. Here’s how to get started and manage it:

- **Create a Database**: Use the admin control panel to set up a new database.
- **Manage It**: Head to [https://dbadmin.dcism.org/](https://dbadmin.dcism.org) to work with your database (e.g., add tables, run queries).

:::tip
Your database name will always start with your username followed by an underscore. For example, mine is `s22103604_` plus whatever name I choose (like `s22103604_chiase`).

## Logging in
To access your database through phpMyAdmin, you’ll need the right credentials:

- **Username**: Use your full database name (e.g., `s22103604_chiase` for me).
- **Password**: Enter the password you set for this database in the admin control panel.
